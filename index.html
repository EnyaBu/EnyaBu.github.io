            Hi! I'm Enya, and I'm passionate about building thoughtful
            technology that supports people. I'm especially interested in
            human-computer interaction and using AI responsibly to enhance
            everyday life. I love designing, learning, and making an impact
            through research and code.

              This was a project from one of my first internships! I built a 3D
              website for the Freedom Company and the Vanderbilt Fab Lab, using
              Three.js to bring it to life.

            <h2>Arrowz Notes App</h2>
            <p>
              I was a founding technical lead for a student-run startup at
              Vanderbilt. Our app promotes guided note-taking for mental health,
              backed by research. I designed and built the interface using React
              Native and Expo, and also contributed to product brainstorming.

      <h1>My Research</h1>
      <p class="research-text">
        My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial
        Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep
        Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Time Series Analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="research-text">
        To pursue this path, I worked in the
        <a href="https://stirlab.org/" class="web-link"
          >Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab</a
        >
        under Dr. Pamela Wisniewski, studying HCI and how teens interact on
        social media â€” and how we can help keep them safe. I also worked at the
        <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/" class="web-link"
          >Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory</a
        >
        under Dr. Nilanjan Sarkar, where I continued my HCI research and
        explored Machine Learning.

      <p class="research-text">
        I led research sessions and participant interviews for our HCI project,
        which evaluated the usability and effectiveness of safety tools and
        nudges for minors on social media platforms. I recruited more than 20
        teen participants for our study by contacting schools and leveraging
        social media, and assisted in preparing and revising IRB protocols to
        ensure ethical research practices involving minors. Here I am at the
        Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Fair!

      <p class="research-text">
        I presented my paper, "Enhancing Athletic Performance through AI: An
        Iterative Prompt Engineering Approach for LLM-Based Coaching Feedback,"
        at HCI International 2025! I also had the wonderful opportunity to serve
        as a student volunteer and had an amazing experience in Sweden. In
        addition to prompt engineering an LLM coach, I studied neural networks â€”
        specifically Siamese neural networks â€” to detect differences between a
        professional's movements and those of a novice.
