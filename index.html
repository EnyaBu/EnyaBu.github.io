            Hi! I'm Enya, and I'm passionate about building thoughtful
            technology that supports people. I'm especially interested in
            human-computer interaction and using AI responsibly to enhance
            everyday life. I love designing, learning, and making an impact
            through research and code.

              This was a project during one of my first internships! I built a
              3D website for the Freedom Company and the Vanderbilt Fab Lab. I
              used Three.js to create this awesome website!

            <h2>Arrowz Notes App</h2>
            <p>
              I was a founding technical lead for a student-run startup at
              Vanderbilt. This app promotes guided note-taking for mental
              health, backed by research. I designed and built the interface
              using React Native and Expo, and helped brainstorm ideas for our
              product! (Peek at me at the top!)

      <h1>My Research</h1>
      <p class="research-text">
        My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial
        Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep
        Learning, Neural Networks, and Time Series Analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="research-text">
        To pursue this path, I worked in the
        <a href="https://stirlab.org/" class="web-link"
          >Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab</a
        >
        under Dr. Pamela Wisniewski, studying HCI and how teens interact on
        social media â€” and how we can keep them safe. I also worked at the
        <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/" class="web-link"
          >Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory</a
        >
        under Dr. Nilanjan Sarkar, where I continued my HCI research and
        explored Machine Learning.

        I led research sessions and participant interviews for our HCI project,
        which evaluated the usability and effectiveness of safety tools and
        nudges for minors on social media platforms. I recruited 20+ teen
        participants for our study by contacting schools and using social media,
        and assisted in preparing and modifying IRB protocols to ensure ethical
        research practices involving minors. Here I am at the Vanderbilt
        Undergraduate Research Fair!

      <p class="research-text">
        I presented my paper "Enhancing Athletic Performance through AI: An
        Iterative Prompt Engineering Approach for LLM-Based Coaching Feedback"
        at HCI International 2025! I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a
        student volunteer as well and had a great experience in Sweden. In
        addition to prompt engineering an LLM coach, I also studied neural
        networks (specifically Siamese neural networks) to detect differences
        between a professional's movements compared to a novice's.
