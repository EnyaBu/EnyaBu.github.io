            Hi! I'm Enya, and I'm passionate about building thoughtful
            technology that supports people. I'm especially interested in
            human-computer interaction and using AI responsibly to enhance
            everyday life. I love designing, learning, and making an impact
            through research and code.

            <p>
              This was a project from one of my first internships. I built an
              interactive 3D website for the Freedom Company and the
              Vanderbilt Fab Lab using Three.js and React. The site features
              custom 3D models, dynamic lighting, and interactive navigation
              that allows users to explore spatial environments. This project
              demonstrates computational approaches to immersive web
              experiences and user engagement through spatial design.

            <h2>Snake Game Recreation</h2>
            <p>
              During my internship at Iron Galaxy Studios, I recreated the
              classic Snake game in easy68k assembly language. This low-level
              implementation required managing memory directly, implementing
              game loop logic, and handling real-time user input processing.
              The project demonstrates understanding of fundamental computer
              architecture and systems programming. Feel free to clone it and

            <p>
              As founding technical lead for this student-run startup at
              Vanderbilt, I designed and built a guided note-taking
              application aimed at supporting mental health through structured
              reflection. Built with React Native and Expo, the app implements
              research-backed intervention strategies and features an
              intuitive interface. I contributed to product strategy,
              brainstormed prototypes, and led technical development. This
              project merges HCI research principles with real-world
              application design.

      <h1>My Research</h1>

      <p class="research-text">
        My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction, particularly examining how we can design AI systems to
        support people's well-being and work.

      <h2 style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 1.8rem; color: var(--cream);">Context Sharing in Large Language Models
        (UCLA HCI Research)</h2>

      <p class="research-text">
        I am currently collaborating with <a href="https://hci.ucla.edu/#aboutus" class="web-link">UCLA's HCI Research
          group</a> on a study examining user perceptions of context
        sharing in large language model systems. Context sharing is the idea of pooling together user histories with an
        LLM. This research investigates how we can balance collective intelligence and collaboration while maintaining
        personal autonomy and privacy, especially as we move into an increasingly distributed world.
      </p>

      <p class="research-text">
        Using Wizard-of-Oz methodology, I conduct user studies across multiple domains including resume assistance,
        mental health support, and diet advice to understand when context sharing feels helpful versus invasive to
        users. My research examines how different framings of data sharing, levels of transparency, and domain-specific
        sensitivities shape user comfort and trust in AI systems. I am analyzing qualitative data from participant
        interviews to identify design principles for context-aware AI that balances personalization benefits with
        privacy concerns.
        This work is being prepared for submission to CHI 2026 LBW.

      <p class="research-text">
        At the <a href="https://stirlab.org/" class="web-link">Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab</a> under Dr.
        Pamela Wisniewski, I researched examining the usability and effectiveness of safety interventions for minors on
        social media platforms.
      </p>

      <p class="research-text">
        Online safety is a critical issue given teens' vulnerability to cyberbullying, privacy breaches, and exposure to
        inappropriate content on social media. To improve digital safety, our project evaluated safety interventions
        such as warning popups and content moderation features through a Wizard-of-Oz study using a simulated social
        media platform. As a research assistant, I recruited teen participants,
        facilitated sessions, and collected qualitative data on their decision-making processes. I helped identify three
        effective nudge strategies in our results: (1) offering multiple safety options (flag, block, report), (2)
        implementing sensitivity filters for offensive content, and (3) providing public visibility cues that make risky
        behaviors apparent to others. These findings demonstrated how interface design can empower teens to make
        informed safety decisions without restricting their autonomy. <a

        At the <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/" class="web-link">Robotics and Autonomous Systems
          Laboratory</a>
        under Dr. Nilanjan Sarkar, I explored how large language models can provide personalized athletic coaching
        feedback.
        My first-author paper, "Enhancing Athletic Performance through AI: An Iterative Prompt Engineering Approach for
        LLM-Based Coaching Feedback," presented at HCI International 2025, introduces a systematic methodology for
        engineering effective prompts that generate contextually appropriate, actionable coaching guidance. <a

      <p class="research-text">
        This work combines technical system development with interpretive analysis of how users perceive and respond to
        AI-generated feedback. I developed evaluation frameworks to assess feedback quality across dimensions of
        specificity, actionability, and motivational tone. Through comparative user studies, I analyzed how
        LLM-generated coaching compares to human expert feedback and identified key factors that influence user trust
        and adherence.
        Additionally, I investigated Siamese neural networks for detecting subtle differences in athletic movement
        patterns, enabling more precise, data-driven coaching interventions.
