        Hi! I'm someone passionate about building thoughtful technology that
        supports people. I'm especially interested in human-computer interaction
        and using AI responsibly to enhance everyday life. I love designing,
        learning, and making an impact through research and code.

              This is a project for one of my first internships! I built a 3D
              website for the Freedom Company and the Vanderbilt Fab Lab. I was
              able to use Three.js to create this awesome website!

            <h2>Arrowz Notes App</h2>
            <p>
              I was a founding technical lead for a student-run startup at
              Vanderbilt. This app is to promote guided note taking for mental
              health, backed by research. I designed and made the interface
              using React Native and Expo, and helped with brainstorming for our
              product! (Peek me at the top!)

      <h1>My Research</h1>
      <p class="research-text">
        My research interests are the following: Human-Computer Interaction,
        Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,
        Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Time Series Analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="research-text">
        To chase this path, I worked in the
        <a href="https://stirlab.org/" class="web-link"
          >Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab</a
        >
        under Dr. Pamela Wisniewski studying HCI and how teens interact on
        social media (and how we can keep them safe). I worked at
        <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/" class="web-link"
          >Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory</a
        >
        under Dr. Nilanjan Sarkar where I continued my HCI research and where I
        also dabbled in Machine Learning.

        I led research sessions and participant interviews for our HCI research
        project, which evaluated the usability and effectiveness of safety tools
        and nudges for minors on social media platforms. I also recruited 20+
        teen participants for our research study by contacting schools and using
        social media, and ssisted in preparing and modifying IRB protocols to
        ensure ethical research practices involving minors. Here I am, at the
        Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Fair!

      <p class="research-text">
        I presented my paper "Enhancing athletic performance through AI: An
        iterative prompt engineering approach for LLM-based coaching feedback"
        at HCI International 2025! I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a
        student volunteer as well, and had a great experience in Sweden. In
        addition to prompt engineering an LLM coach, I also studied neural
        networks, specifically siamese neural networks to detect the differences
        between a professional's movements compared to a novice's.
